 **`BackEnd Skills Coupled With Data Analytics`**

Anyone would be revered and admired by others for pursuing their passion as a career. That is preciously how I envision myself. I am a motivated software developer, data analytics enthusiast, and a networking curious student of life. A self-driven learner with a keen interest in the ever-changing technological world. My curiosity is mostly peaked by backend development, most specifically with JavaScript using NodeJS. I always seek to learn more not only from my preferred development language but also from others with vibrant and active communities such as Python(Jupyter Notebook) and R for data analytics. Configuring networks using Cisco Packet Tracer as a pastime activity and an avid Call of Duty Gamer😎🎮. Moreover, one of the best no. 11 on a pitch⚽.

<summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Timeline 📅</h3></summary>
My introduction to coding began in 2020 when I was enrolled at Kenyatta University to pursue Computer Science. With limited knowledge, insight, training, or mentorship, I had to navigate through the vast computing world. Luckily, I quickly adapted and found my balance with web development, specifically backend website development. The help from friends, colleagues, and expert advice from various credible sources has been benefitial in training. I became well-tuned to best development practices such as ES6 practices and producing code with efficient time complexities. All I know is that I am only starting to experience the best of what is sure to come for my development journey.
